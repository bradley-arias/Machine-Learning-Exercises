# Machine-Learning-Exercises

This repository holds my solutions for select homework questions from UC Berkeley's CompSci 189/289A Introduction to Machine Learning course, taken in the Fall of 2024 with Dr. Listgartener and Dr. Sareemi.

The questions selected are the ones that were focused on programming/coding, where my additions are signified with comments. There should also be relevant comments that reference the prompts or give context for the block of code, as well as comments provided by the original writers of auxillory code files, functions, and skeleton code, to perserve as much educational information and credit where due. I have also made effort to transfer solutions to questions that ask for qualitative accounts on what the code is doing, why certain things are happening, ect.
